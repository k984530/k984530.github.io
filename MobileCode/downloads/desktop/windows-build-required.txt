Windows Build Required
======================

The Windows version of Mobile Code needs to be built on a Windows machine.

Flutter does not support cross-platform builds, meaning:
- Windows apps must be built on Windows
- Linux apps must be built on Linux
- macOS apps must be built on macOS

To create the Windows build:

1. Set up a Windows development environment
2. Install Flutter for Windows
3. Clone the Mobile Code repository
4. Run: flutter build windows --release
5. Package the output from build\windows\x64\runner\Release\
6. Upload the packaged file here

For now, the Windows download is marked as "Coming Soon" on the website.
