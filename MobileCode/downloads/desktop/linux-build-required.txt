Linux Build Required
====================

The Linux version of Mobile Code needs to be built on a Linux machine.

Flutter does not support cross-platform builds, meaning:
- Windows apps must be built on Windows
- Linux apps must be built on Linux
- macOS apps must be built on macOS

To create the Linux build:

1. Set up a Linux development environment (Ubuntu recommended)
2. Install Flutter for Linux
3. Install required dependencies:
   sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev
4. Clone the Mobile Code repository
5. Run: flutter build linux --release
6. Package the output from build/linux/x64/release/bundle/
7. Upload the packaged file here

For now, the Linux download is marked as "Coming Soon" on the website.
